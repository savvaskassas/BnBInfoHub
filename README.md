# Airbnb Guest Info App

A web application designed for **Airbnb hosts** to provide all necessary **guest information** in one place. Guests can access **WiFi details, check-in instructions, property location, and other essential info** from any device.

## 📌 Project Status

> **Note:**  
> The current version includes only the **frontend** (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).  
> The backend (Node.js, Express.js) and advanced features such as **SMS notifications** are **planned for future development** and are not yet implemented.

## ✨ Features (Current implementation)
✔ **Check-In System:** Guests can enter their arrival time and see a simulated “key code” after a countdown.  
✔ **WiFi Credentials:** Guests can view and copy the WiFi network and password.  
✔ **Interactive Map:** Displays the exact location of the property via Google Maps.  
✔ **Additional Property Information:** Includes amenities such as kitchen, parking, and air conditioning.  
✔ **Mobile-Friendly UI:** Simple and intuitive interface for both **desktop and mobile** users.

## 🚧 Planned Features (Not implemented yet)
- **Backend server** (Node.js, Express.js)
- **Automatic SMS Notification** to host when guests schedule check-in (Twilio API)
- **Persistent data storage** (database or file-based)
- **User authentication**

---

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Vanilla JS)
- **Backend:** _[Planned: Node.js, Express.js]_
- **APIs:** _[Planned: Twilio (SMS Notifications)]_

---

## 🚀 How It Works (Current Frontend Only)
1. Guests access the app and see an interface with **Check-In, WiFi, Map, and Info buttons**.  
2. When a guest **schedules their check-in time**, the **"Key Code" button unlocks** at the specified time (simulated, no real backend logic).  
3. Guests can also access **WiFi details**, **Google Maps directions**, and **other property information**.
